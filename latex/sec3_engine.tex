\section{The Benchmark Engine: \texttt{benchmark.py}}
MiniZinc cannot optimize the size of the transition matrix dynamically. \texttt{benchmark.py} acts as a meta-solver implementing \textbf{Iterative Deepening}.

\subsection{Iterative Search and Timeout}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
while not found:
    instance = minizinc.Instance(solver, model)
    instance["k"] = k
    result = instance.solve(timeout=timedelta(seconds=TIMEOUT_SEC))
    if result.status == minizinc.Status.SATISFIED:
        return k, result
    elif result.status == minizinc.Status.UNSATISFIABLE:
        k += 1
\end{lstlisting}
\textbf{Explanation:} The script tests $k=1, 2, \dots$ sequentially. Since our model is optimal-length-constrained, the first $k$ that returns SATISFIED is mathematically the minimum plan length. A cumulative timeout of 300s is enforced to handle NP-hard instances.
