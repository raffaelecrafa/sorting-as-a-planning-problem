\section{Advanced Benchmarking: \texttt{benchmark\_strategies.py}}
To solve $N=30$, we integrated \textbf{Cycle Decomposition} (CP 2025, Slide 10) to determine the exact theoretical lower bound.

\subsection{Cycle Decomposition Lower Bound}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def count_cycles(vec):
    n = len(vec); visited = [False] * n; cycles = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycles += 1; curr = i
            while not visited[curr]:
                visited[curr] = True; curr = vec[curr] - 1
    return cycles

k_min = n - count_cycles(start_v)
\end{lstlisting}
\textbf{Explanation:} Group theory states that the minimum swaps to sort a permutation is $N - \text{cycles}$. By starting our loop at \texttt{k\_min}, we bypass the entire UNSAT phase, saving minutes of computation for large $N$.

\subsection{Heuristics and Restarts}
We tested \textbf{Luby Restarts} combined with \textbf{Randomized Value Selection} to prevent the solver from getting stuck in barren subtrees. The \texttt{dom\_w\_deg} heuristic was introduced to prioritize variables involved in frequent conflicts.
