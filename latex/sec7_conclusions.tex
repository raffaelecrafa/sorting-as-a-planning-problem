\section{Conclusions}
The project successfully demonstrated that "Sorting as Planning" is highly sensitive to model propagation and search heuristics. 

The combination of \textbf{Inverse Channeling} and \textbf{Domain Consistency} provided the necessary inferential power to manage permutations. However, the most decisive factor was the integration of \textbf{Group Theory properties} (Cycle Decomposition and Parity), which allowed the meta-solver to focus exclusively on the optimal horizon $k$. 

In conclusion, Constraint Programming is an exceptionally powerful tool for planning when the underlying mathematical structure of the problem is exploited to prune the search space effectively.
