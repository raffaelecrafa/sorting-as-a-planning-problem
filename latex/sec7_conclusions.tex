\section{Conclusions}

This work shows that constraint programming, when paired with well-designed constraints and effective search strategies, can efficiently solve the sorting-as-planning problem even for challenging instances. The best results are achieved by combining strong propagation, mathematical insights (such as cycle decomposition), and restart policies. While no single strategy is always optimal, the "smallest" heuristic with Luby restarts proved both fast and reliable.
